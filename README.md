## My process
First, I initialized my project as a public repository on GitHub.
Then I looked at the designs to start planning how to approach the project.
I added Bootstrap and structured the project content in HTML.
I added styles with CSS and Bootstrap considering the challenge specifications.
Once it was finished, I uploaded it to the previously linked GitHub repository.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Frontend framework
